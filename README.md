# sudokuPython

This project was completed in April 2021.

Python backtracking algorithm with a graphical user interface that visually demonstrates how the algorithm solvves puzzles. 
Includes a stopwatch to run tests on how quick the puzzles can be solved. GUI refreshing slows down algorithm significantly as the updates are triggered during the solving process. 

This was a self-directed project during my 11th grade of highschool alongside my Computer Science elective.
